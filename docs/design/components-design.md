## Components Design

- **Buttons**:
  - Rounded corners with a radius of `0.375rem` (`rounded` class).
  - Hover and active states with slight color variations for feedback.
  
- **Inputs**:
  - Border radius of `0.375rem` (`rounded` class) and clear borders for focus clarity.
  - `box-border` to ensure proper sizing.
  
- **Chat Messages**:
  - User messages are aligned to the right with a distinct background color (`bg-blue-500`).
  - Bot messages are aligned to the left with a neutral background (`bg-gray-200`).
